One great challenge during my PhD was determining how to reliably quantify performance in alpine skiing over timeâ€”whether over days, weeks, or months. The best way to do this in alpine skiing has been much debated, with scientists using various measures such as energy mechanics \cite{supej_differential_2008, supej_how_2010, supej_mechanical_2011} , differences in mechanical energy divided by time, section times \cite{supej_relations_2006}, lateral skidding of skis \cite{kirby_development_2009}, and time loss per elevation difference and distance travelled per elevation difference \cite{federolf_quantifying_2012}. Throughout my doctoral research, I have consistently expressed performance in terms of time, which is the conventional way to quantify performance in skiing and allowed me to operate on the same scale as practitioners do. Using this same scale therefore allowed me to effectively evaluate and communicate the raw effect size to my audience. In my PhD, I have adopted two different time measures: in paper 1 and 2 I expressed time as the difference to the time when the skier skied the section straight down (straight gliding), whereas, in paper 3, I used the raw time to quantify performance . Regardless of these measures, during my PhD work, I encountered several challenges associated with using time to measure performance, even under the most controlled conditions, such as in the indoor ski hall. Therefore, I would like to make some methodological considerations regarding the use of time. These considerations will lead to the question of what estimand perhaps should try to address in a between-subjects design to study learning across days to avoid some of these challenges.

To begin, I conducted a trend analysis (Bayesian multilevel growth model) of all the skiers' times as they skied straight down the section for all the sessions in paper 3. From this analysis, we found that the straight gliding times for all ski groups (A, B, C, and D) increased linearly from the first session (baseline) to the last session (transfer). Although I cannot definitively explain why the straight gliding times of the ski groups increased, I am quite confident that differences in the length of the course section are not the main explanation. This is because we used a measuring tape, and there was a tight cluster of boreholes at the finish line, with only a few centimeters of difference that we unfortunately do not have pictures of. I also do not believe the main reason is changes in the skiers' starting procedures or execution of straight gliding, as the skiers were diligent and interested in performing this task as well as possible. I believe the best explanation involves the snow conditions and how we prepared them.  

The question is, what consequences does this have for the results, and how can we address these challenges the best possible way? First, one challenge this creates is the need to exercise caution in interpreting 'true' learning from the estimated change in race times. From the figures, we find that the skiers improved their race times significantly over the sessions despite the increased straight gliding times, suggesting that the surface had become slower. Therefore, the 'true' improvement is likely better than estimated. A less conservative and perhaps better way to express the skiers' 'true' learning is to use the difference in straight gliding times for each session to account for variations in the snow surface. This is the performance measure we used in paper 1 and paper 2. However, although this measure may better capture the skiers' learning, we do not know whether it underestimates or overestimates the learning. Another problem is that the straight gliding in itself is a random variable that introduce variation and could adds noise to measure. In paper 3, we had to move away from this measure because the straight gliding lane crossed many holes from the previous courses. Due to these challenges, it is difficult to determine the actual improvement of the skiers. Scientists therefore face two choices: either use raw race times, which is likely a conservative method that underestimates the real improvement, or express time as the difference in straight gliding, which may better account for variations in the surface and therefore express progress more accurately. The cost of the latter approach is that it underestimates or overestimates performance and could increase noise. 

Another solution is to change the research question (estimand) in the study. Instead of an estimand that addresses change (e.g., multilevel growth model), the study could address whether the learning groups differ in retention if their performance was equal at the baseline, corresponding to the logic of an ANCOVA. If we have a design where skiers have undergone tests simultaneously, we can estimate this group difference, indirectly avoiding the question of change. Therefore, we used ANCOVA and raw race times in the paper 3. 

One potential way to improve estimates in future research is to test more levels within the ski groups. This would allow the groups to have varying effects of the treatment and achieve better estimates through partial pooling. We attempted to set up this model, but it did not converge due to having too few levels. It might have been better to divide the ski groups into smaller sub-groups that tested at different times. This approach could have provided more levels and potentially better estimates through partial pooling. However, it must be emphasized that conducting studies like ours is very difficult and time-consuming.
