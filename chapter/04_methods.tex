\section{Study overview}
The thesis is based on data from two learning experiments, referred to as Study \RNum{1}  and Study \RNum{2}. Study \RNum{1} has resulted in Paper \RNum{1} og Paper \RNum{2}. Study \RNum{2} has resulted in Paper \RNum{3}. Additionally, we used data from this learning experiment for an additional analysis reported in Section \ref{results_strategies}.

Study \RNum{1} was designed to test whether frequent task switching can enhance learning. This experiment spanned eight days, starting with a baseline test on day one, followed by three days of training intervention. This training intervention contrasted two training groups learning to pump on flat slopes in slalom: an interleaved training group, which practiced pumping on three slalom courses each day in interleaved order (ensuring skiers never repeated the same slope consecutively), and a blocked training group, which practiced pumping on one slalom course each day (with the order counterbalanced across skiers). After the training period, the skiers had a three-day break without skiing. On the third day, they completed a retention test. This study resulted in Paper \RNum{1}, which reports the learning effects between the two learning groups. Additionally, we collected positional data from the skiers using a local positioning system during the baseline and retention to study the kinematic changes due to the intervention. This analysis is reported in Paper \RNum{2}.

On baseline (day 1), all skiers performed a baseline test that consisted of three runs in each of the three slalom courses A, B and C  (see Fig.\ref{fig:slalomcourses}), performed in an interleaved order, plus a straight gliding (SG) before and after these runs. The skiers were then assigned to either the interleaved or the blocked learning groups. Skiers in the interleaved group skied all courses each day, executed in an interleaved order under the condition that no more than two runs in the same course would occur consecutively. Skiers in the blocked group performed all runs on a single course (that is, course A, B or C) in a given session. The order in which the skiers performed the course was counterbalanced across skiers. After a retention interval of 72 h, the skiers returned to complete a retention test that was similar to the baseline test. The figure is adapted based on the illustration figure in \cite{magelssen_is_2022}.}

Study \RNum{2} was designed to identify the most effective teaching signal for helping skilled performers learn strategy selection to enhance performance. This learning experiment spanned three days, beginning with a baseline test on day 1. This baseline test was followed by a training intervention (acquisition) consisting of three training sessions. The intervention contrasted reinforcement learning with two supervised learning groups as teaching signals. In the reinforcement learning group, the skiers learned to select optimal strategies by seeing their times to inform their next strategy choice. Conversely, in the supervised learning groups, the coaches selected strategies for the skiers. In the supervised (target skill) learning group, we educated experienced coaches on the theoretically optimal strategy and instructed them to select this strategy for the skiers and give them feedback on this strategy after every trial. In the supervised (free choice) learning group, we recruited two coaches from each group of the tested ski teams to select a strategy that they believed would make the skier faster. Before allowing the skiers (reinforcement learning) or the coaches (supervised learning) to freely choose strategies, we conducted a forced exploration session where all participants tested every strategy. On day 3, the skiers performed a retention test and a transfer test, independently select strategies. This study resulted in Paper \RNum{3}, which reports the learning effects of the two teaching signals on strategy selection. Additionally, we used data from the forced exploration session to analyze and estimate which strategies yielded the best performance for the skiers. Denne analysen er også gjort Paper\RNum{3}, men vi har gjort en ekstra analyse som vi har rapportert her.

The skiers were then assigned to one of three learning groups (see b). In their assigned group, the skiers underwent three acquisition sessions, comprising one forced exploration session (skiers performed all strategies) and two free choice sessions (skiers or coaches could choose strategies themselves). On the last day, skiers completed a retention and transfer test where they could pick strategies themselves, again without receiving race time feedback. \textbf{b.} Illustration of the learning groups in the study. The supervised (target skill) learning group involved coaches consistently choosing the theoretically best strategy (except during forced exploration), while in the supervised (free choice) learning group coaches freely selected strategies.

\section{Setup}
All studies were conducted in the indoor ski hall, SNØ, located in Oslo, Norway (\url{https://snooslo.no/}). In this ski hall, we used the upper part of the race hill, which is a long flat section with two small rollers. The snow of this flat section was watered before testing each group of skiers to ensure uniform and fair conditions for all skiers.

    \label{fig:slalomcourses}
\end{figure}

In study \RNum{1}, we set up three slalom courses to test the contextual interference effect. These courses required skiers to execute pumping movements with different timings and amplitudes for effective performance. All three courses had a vertical gate distance of 10 meters due to space constraints, forcing parallel setup. However, the courses had varying offsets: 1.2 meters for Course A, 1.7 meters for Course B, and 2.2 meters for Course C. These specific gate offsets were chosen to create diverse pumping demands without making it impossible to pump. Fig. 

In study 2, we set up two slalom courses to test. The main slalom course was used in all sessions except the transfer test and featured a 10-meter distance and a 1.9-meter offset. The transfer test assessed skiers' ability to transfer learning to a more realistic alpine race course. This test course included a progression in gate offset: five gates at 2.2 meters, seven gates at 1.7 meters, and seven gates at 1.2 meters. 

In both studies, we used stubbies (short gates) instead of long gates to minimize energy dissipation upon hitting the gate\cite{minetti_biomechanics_2018}. Using stubbies allowed skiers to focus better on skill execution of the strategy without the distraction of clearing the gate, which could hinder learning. In addition, this approach minimized hole creation that occurs when a long gate is forcefully slammed into the ground. 

We adopted the same standardized start procedure in both studies. The involved setting the start gate 20 meters before the first gate. Here, skiers were instructed to place their toe bindings behind the starting gate. Upon receiving the clearance signal, skiers were to place their skis parallel, lift the poles from the ground, and glide out of the start gate without using poling or skating to generate propulsion. Timing was recorded using a wireless photocell timing system (HC Timing wiNode and wiTimer; Oslo, Norway), starting when the skier crossed the first photocell pair situated 10 meters below the starting gate. (See https://osf.io/9numq for a supplementary video illustrating the starting procedure and setup).


\section{Participants}
Our target population for making inferential claims was skilled alpine skiers worldwide. Therefore, we recruited only skiers aged 15 and older, marking the entry age for participating in Federation Internationale de Ski (FIS) races. We chose skiers aged 15 years and older to ensure that they could handle the icy snow conditions we prepared in the ski hall and had the basic skills necessary to learn the strategies we developed. Beyond these criteria, we deliberately recruited skiers with diverse skill levels—from skilled junior ski academy skiers to Olympic skiers—to enhance the generalizability of our findings.

Our sample size approach in both studies was to recruit as many skiers as possible during the available testing window, and was justified by the 'resource constraints' and the 'whole population' criteria \cite{lakens_sample_2022}. First, the relatively small and geographically dispersed population of skilled alpine skiers limits the number of available participants.  Second, coaches and skiers must be willing to participate in the intervention. For coaches and skiers at this level to show this willingness, they must be convinced that the intervention will benefit the skiers' development, as it typically replaces the skiers' regular training due to their already high training volumes. Finally, the narrow testing window, typically in the spring and summer, coincides with the indoor skiing training periods for many ski teams, leading to a high demand for training lanes. These combined factors make it challenging to recruit a large number of participants and to reach a specific benchmark.  

In Study 1, we successfully recruited 66 skilled alpine skiers (31 females) from Norway, with a mean age of 17 years (SD = 2.7). Of these, 51 skiers attended ski academies and had either already earned International Ski Federation (FIS) points or were about to do so in the upcoming season. Twelve skiers competed at the club level in age-specific categories for those aged 14 to 16 (but with the necessary skill level), while three skiers were elite skiers outside the national team preparing for the next season. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, 12 of these 66 skiers were quarantined and unable to participate in the retention session. We did not ask the first groups of the tested ski teams to report their FIS points on slalom, resulting in a lack of FIS points and world ranking data for these skiers. 

Study 2 involved a smaller sample (n=18) from the larger pool of skiers in Study 1 (n=66), where we recorded the skiers' positions using a local positioning system in the upper section of the course. The smaller sample included 18 alpine skiers (mean age = 16.7 years, SD = 1.1; 7 females, 11 males) from three ski academies. Except for three skiers, all participants had previously competed in FIS races, with recorded FIS points in slalom (M = 115, SD = 31). However, these FIS points may not accurately reflect their skill levels due to the pandemic-related challenges in organizing races, which limited opportunities to accumulate points.

In Study 3, we successfully recruited 98 alpine skiers from Norway and Sweden (mean age = 18.1 years, SD = 2; 40 females, 58 males). Two skiers were excluded from the analysis due to injury prior to the study (n=1) or sickness (n=1), resulting in 96 skiers who completed the study and were included in the analysis. The tested groups of skiers included five ski academies, three senior development teams, and two national ski teams. The skiers were generally highly skilled, with mean FIS points in slalom 55.4 (SD=32). Their median world rank was 605, though there was considerable variability (Q1 = 248, Q3 = 1390.5). A smaller subset of skiers (n = 13) were not world-ranked, as they had yet to compete in internationally sanctioned races necessary for calculating FIS points and rankings. Before data collection for this study, we set the minimum sample size to 80 skiers, which we deemed appropriate for this context. Prior to data collection, we conducted power simulations for sample sizes of 80, 100, and 120 skiers. These simulations revealed powers of 0.60, 0.75, and 0.80, respectively, for the smallest effect size of interest (0.3 second difference between groups) (\url{https://osf.io/c4t28}). 


\section{Design and procedure}

\subsection{Study 1}
In Study 1, we employed a between-subjects design and allocated skiers to either a blocked or interleaved learning group. The experiment began with a baseline test consisting of nine trials (three trials on each of courses A, B, and C), where skiers skied as quickly as possible without receiving time feedback. The trials in these courses were distributed randomly to each skier under the condition that the skier did not perform no more than two consecutive runs on the same course. In addition, the skiers performed a straight gliding task on a dedicated lane before, midway (randomly assigned), and after the nine trials.

After the baseline test, we used a randomized-blocked design to allocate skiers into either the blocked or interleaved learning group based on their baseline test times. Specifically, we extracted each skier's best run from the baseline on each course and divided it by the average of the straight gliding runs from the baseline. Skiers were then ranked from fastest to slowest and paired in ascending order, and each consecutive pair was randomly assigned to either the interleaved or blocked group.

Immediately after the baseline test on day one, skiers attended a workshop where we explained the mechanical principles of the pumping technique and presented quantitative evidence supporting this strategy. Skiers then completed three training sessions over three days, with each session including 15 runs: 12 runs on the three courses and three straight-gliding runs. The interleaved group skied all three courses each day in a randomized interleaved order, ensuring no more than two consecutive runs on the same course. The blocked group performed all their runs on one course (A, B, or C) per day, with the course order counterbalanced across participants. 

Three days (72 hours) after the last training session, the skiers returned for a retention test, consisting of 12 runs (three runs on each of the three slalom courses and three straight-gliding runs). The order of the runs in the courses was scheduled in a semirandom order, with the condition that no more than two consecutive runs could be performed in the same course. As in the baseline test, the skiers performed a straight gliding task on a dedicated lane before, midway (randomly assigned), and after the nine trials. The skiers were instructed to ski as fast as possible but did not receive any performance feedback during the posttest. This design allowed us to compare the effects of blocked versus interleaved practices on the learning and performance of the pumping strategy. 


\subsection{Study 2}
In Study 2, we employed a between-subjects design and framed the task of learning to choose effective strategies as a multiarmed bandit problem\cite{sutton_reinforcement_2018}. Here, the options (or bandits) that the skiers needed to learn and select to ski as quickly as possible were the four technical strategies detailed in section \ref{introduction: strategies}.

To test which teaching signals most effectively drive this learning process, we allocated skiers into one of three learning groups. In the supervised (free choice) learning group, skiers were told by their coaches which strategy to use, either the one they believed to be the best or most appropriate for the skier. This learning group represents the conventional teaching strategy in alpine skiing. We complemented this learning group with a supervised (target skill) learning group, where coaches instructed skiers to select the strategy that we defined as the theoretically best strategy (that is, "extend with rock skis forward") based on mechanics and field observations of elite skiers (see section \ref{introduction: strategies}. Since the skiers were instructed to use the theoretical optimal strategy, this learning group served as a benchmark for the upper limit of performance achievable through optimal strategy choices. In both of these supervised learning groups, the coaches saw the skiers’ race times but did not communicate them to the skiiers. We compared these two learning groups to a reinforcement learning group where the skiers learned the values of the strategies by trying a strategy and learning from evaluations (that is, race times) instead of from a coach.
%In the supervised (target skill) learning group, the skiers were instructed by a coach to choose the theoretically best strategy (that is, extend with rock skis forward) and received feedback on their execution of this strategy after every trial. For this learning group, we engaged highly experienced ski coaches to ensure credibility in promoting this strategy, and these coaches were educated by us before the data collection. To the skiers, these coaches told that the 'extend with rock skis forward’ strategy was the most effective strategy for skiing fast on flat terrain in slalom, citing theory and quantitive evidence from research literature in alpine skiing mechanics \cite{reid_kinematic_2010, mote_accelerations_1983, lind_physics_2013, lemaster_skiers_1999, lemaster_ultimate_2010}. In the supervised (free choice) learning group, the skiers were assigned to one of two coaches selected from the ski team undergoing testing. These coaches were instructed to maximize their assigned group of skiers' performance in the slalom course by choosing one of the four strategies for each trial. Although the coaches in these two supervised learning groups had access to the skiers’ data after each trial, they were not allowed to share the times with the skiers. In contrast, the reinforcement learning group learned the value of these strategies themselves by observing the times for a chosen strategy after every trial to guide their strategy choices, with the aim to select the best strategy. This group was not assigned a coach but a person to communicate with the skiers, record their choices, and encourage them to ski quickly to prevent boredom effects. See the original paper for more information.

The learning experiment began with a baseline session consisting of four runs through the slalom course (main course in Fig. \ref{fig:slalomcourses}) plus one straight gliding run where the skiers skied straight down the course section in a dedicated lane. Before these four runs and straight gliding, the skiers completed two warm-up runs: one as free skiing and one as a warm-up in the course, where they received instructions and feedback on their starting procedure. 

After the baseline, we assigned the skiers to three learning groups: supervised (target skill) learning, supervised (free choice) learning, and reinforcement learning. For this assignment, we used a randomized blocked approach to account for preexisting differences among the skiers \cite{maxwell_designing_2017}. Specifically, we computed each skier’s average performance across the four baseline trials and ranked them accordingly. We then created blocks, with sizes corresponding to the three learning groups, and assigned the skiers to these predefined blocks based on their rankings. Finally, we randomly allocated the skiers within each block to the different learning groups. Meanwhile, the skiers had a 60-minute break in a warm zone. 

The learning groups participated in sessions at different times to prevent treatment
diffusion \cite{maxwell_designing_2017}. Since the ski group consisted of teams that regularly trained and lived together during data collection, they were instructed to keep session information private. To complete the learning experiment within the ski hall's opening hours, the two supervised learning groups underwent training simultaneously. We arranged coach stations in the finishing area with space and vision dividers to prevent information leakage between coaches. Additionally, a Python script was used to fetch race times from the timing system, which were filtered for each coach and transmitted to the respective station so that each coach could only see their own skiers' times (SEE). The learning group that begun traing after the learning group assignment (reinforcement learning versus supervised learning) was randomized and counterbalanced across the ski teams tested. 

During the first session following the learning group assignment, we engaged the skiers in forced exploration. Here, we began by gathering the skiers within each learning group and followed by introducing them to the four strategies identified to enhance racing times on flat slopes in slalom. Each strategy was detailed with illustrative drawings and word explanations, as outlined in (SJEKK). To ensure understanding, skiers participated in two short familiarization trials for each strategy or continued until their execution met our standards. After reviewing the strategies, we asked the skiers and the coaches in the supervised (free choice) learning group to rank the strategies (1=best; 4=worst) based on their perceived effectiveness in improving race times on flat sections of a slalom course. We explicitly instructed the coaches and skiers not to discuss the strategies with each other during the instruction and ranking process. Notably, the same instructor conducted all learning sessions within the tested ski group. Following this review, the skiers performed eight trials on the slalom course, testing all strategies with two trials per strategy. Strategies were randomly assigned, ensuring that the first and last four trials included all strategies. During this session, the reinforcement learning group received feedback on their timing, while the coach provided feedback in the supervised learning groups.

On the second day, the skiers completed two free choice sessions, each comprising a total of 6 trials in the same slalom courses that were used for the baseline testing the day before (that is, the main course). Prior to the 6 free choice trials, the skiers performed one warm-up free skiing run and one warm-up run in the slalom course. In these sessions, the supervised (target skill) learning group consistently selected the theoretically best strategy (that is, 'extend with rock skis forward'). Conversely, in the supervised (free choice) learning group and the reinforcement learning group, the coach and the skiers, respectively, had the autonomy to choose the skiing strategy for each run. After each session, coaches (except supervised target skills) and skiers were asked to re-evaluate and rank the strategies.

On the third and last day, the skiers performed a retention test and a transfer test to assess the effect of the training approaches on learning and performance. The retention test was performed in the same course as the baseline and acquisition sessions, whereas the transfer test was performed in the transfer course and involved a progression in gate offset from start to finish. Since the transfer test was a new course, we allowed the skiers to inspect the course before the test. The retention and transfer tests were conducted with the three learning groups together. None of the learning groups received any feedback from coaches or time during these tests. After each test, the skiers were asked to rank the strategies.








%Læringseksperimentet begynte med en baseline som bestod av fire runder i slalåmløypen (main course in Fig. \ref{fig:slalomcourses}), pluss en straightgliding runde der utøverne kjørte rett ned løypeseksjonen i en egen dedikert bane for dette. Før utøverne gjennomførte disse fire rundene og straight glidingen gjennomførte de to oppvarmingsrunde: en gjennomført som frikjøring og som gjennomført som oppvarming i løypen, der de fikk instruksjoner og tilbakemelding på utførelsen av startprosedyren. 

%Etter dette allokerte vi utøverne i tre læringsgrupper supervised (target skill) learning, supervised (free choice) learning and reinforcement learning. For denne oppgaven brukte vi en randomisert blocked approach for å ta hensyn til preeksisterende forskjeller mellom utøvere. Specifically, we computed each skier’s average across the four trials at baseline and ranked them accordingly. We then created \textit{n} blocks with block sizes corresponding to our three learning groups for the entire list of skiers and assigned these skiers to these predefined blocks. Finally, we randomly allocated the skiers to the different learning groups within each block (Fig. \ref{fig:experiment}b). I mellomtiden hadde utøverne en pause på 60 minutter i varm sone. 





\section{Measures and analysis}
De ulike målene og forskningspørsmålet har favnet nokså bredt. Derfor har jeg valgt å dele inn measures og analyse etter hva som er formålet med de enkelte studiene. 


\subsection{Paper 1}
In Paper \RNum{1}, we tested the contextual interference effect on skill learning in skilled alpine skiers. To test this learning effect, we calculated performance as the time difference between the run time and the average time of runs where the athletes performed straight gliding during the session. We tested the contextual interference effect by performing separate analyses for the acquisition and retention sessions.

To examine differences between learning groups during the acquisition sessions, we numbered the runs for each slalom course from 1 to 12 in ascending order and batched them into three acquisition trial blocks (runs 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12 were grouped into blocks 1, 2, and 3, respectively). This approach followed the conventions of previous studies on contextual interference \cite{shea_contextual_1979, lee_locus_1983}. In Paper \RNum{1}, we calculated the average performance within each block and modeled this using a linear mixed-effect regression model that included a random intercept for skier and ski team (compound symmetry model structure ). For a complete description, see the published paper\cite{magelssen_is_2022}. In this thesis, I reanalyzed the acquisition data using the raw data instead and reported it as regression instead of ANOVA output. To model acquisition, I predicted performance using Block (blocks 1, 2, and 3), Learning Group (interleaved and blocked), and Course (A, B, and C), along with their interactions. In addition, I allowed skiers and ski teams to have their own unique intercepts by including a random intercept in the model. To model the difference between the learning groups on retention, I predicted retention with Learning Group (interleaved, blocked) and added it to baseline performance as a covariate. In contrast to the model used in the published paper (Paper \RNum{1}), in this thesis, I performed separate analyses for the three courses (A, B and C). In both analysis, I coded the factors with a simple coding scheme, where the intercepts represent the estimated mean of the cell means, and the contrasts represent the estimated difference with respect to the reference level, set for the blocked learning group. To model the difference between the learning groups on retention, I predicted retention with Learning Group (interleaved, blocked) and added it to baseline performance as a covariate. In contrast to the model used in the published paper (Paper \RNum{1}), in this thesis, I performed separate analyses for the three courses (A, B and C). The models were fitted using classical frequentist statistics and fitted with the lme4 package \cite{bates_fitting_2015} in the R \cite{r_core_team_r_2022} programming language. Two-tailed p values and degrees of freedom for each model were derived using the lmerTest package \cite{kuznetsova_lmertest_2017} via the Satterthwaite approximation method. Alpha was set to 0.05 for all test statistics.

\subsection{Paper 2}
In Paper \RNum{1}, we observed that skiers greatly improved their race times from baseline to retention. In Paper \RNum{2}, we followed up this finding by exploring how the kinematics changed to explain this improvement. For three of the ski teams participating in the study, we monitored the skiers using a local positioning system (Catapult ClearSky T6; Catapult Sports: Australia) in a five gate long section in the upper section of the course.  Here, we asked whether we could explain this improvement through changes in kinematics in one of the slalom courses (Course B), which was most representative of a typical slalom course. See Fig. \ref{fig:slalomcourses}) for the course dimension for this course. Because race time in alpine ski racing is a function of speed and path length, there are two ways in which the signature of the kinematic changes can manifest: alteration in speed or path length. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine which of these explanations is most likely given our data and to explore the signature of these kinematic changes.

The local positioning system was set up to cover the area from the first photocell (gate G-4) until the second intermediate split (Finish), which covered an area of approximately 90 m (length) and 30 m (width) (see Fig. ). For the setup, we deployed ten nodes on each side of the hall (@fig-design panels \textbf{d} and \textbf{e}). One node served as the master node and was positioned on the skier’s right side of the course. Unfortunately, due to the narrowness of the ski hall in the upper part of the course, the wall was too close to the nodes, creating a signal interference that reduced the data quality and did not improve until the skiers descended further down where the hall widened. Consequently, we only have data from the local positioning system for a smaller section of the course (Gate 1 to Finish). In the Supplementary Document \textbf{c} in Paper \RNum{2}, we elaborate on this challenge in more detail. Each skier wore a manufactured-supplied vest that supported a lightweight (28 g) mobile node (firmware version: 1.40), measuring L: 40 mm × H: 52 mm × D: 14 mm. The local positioning system provided positional data as skiers descended through the course section (sampling frequency ˜10 Hz), enabling us to compute their speed and path length. Compared to motion capture system, the local positioning system has been found to operate within the range of 0.21-0.35 m of error in distance for short agility test courses with an optimal setup (but much worse with a suboptimal setup) \cite{luteberget_validity_2018}. 

To use the local positioning system for studying kinematics in skiing, we had to perform additional processing because the system is designed for use on horizontal planes, such as in football and handball. In these applications, the vertical component of the position output is projected onto a horizontal plane, setting the vertical position to a fixed value. Since the ski slope was inclined, we projected the position output onto a virtual plane that was parallel to the average slope incline. This virtual plane, containing the X and Y coordinates, was created using tachymetry measurements (Leica Builder 509 Total Station, Leica Geosystems AG, Switzerland) of the start and finish of the course and the local positioning system nodes placed along the course. The position measurements of the nodes were also used to calibrate the local positioning system.  Since skiers did not ski in that virtual plane but rather along the snow surface, where the snow surface shape was not uniform, the two-dimensional local positioning system positions of the virtual plane of the skiers were projected onto the snow surface in the normal direction to the virtual plane. The snow surface onto which the virtual plane positions were projected was also captured using the tachymeter by measuring points approximately every meter where the terrain was uniform and more often when the terrain was changing (in terrain transitions). The measured points on the snow surface were triangulated and smoothed on a rectangular grid using cubic spline functions  \cite{gilgien_determination_2013}. 

To calculate the kinematic variables that we adressed in this study, we used the following procedure. First, we filtered the skier position data with a cubic spline function since the skier trajectory resembles a harmonic motion. In this filtering, we gave each 3D position equalweights and set the tolerance factor (lambda) to 0.5 for the horizontal and vertical components, consistent with a previous study \cite{gilgien_determination_2013}. Then, we calculated the instantaneous speed and acceleration norm from the spline filtered position and time data. Speed and acceleration were derived as the first and second position-time derivatives using the finite central difference formulae \cite{gilat_numerical_2013}. The acceleration norm along the volcity vector was calculated as theprojection of the acceleration on the velocity vector. The speed and acceleration norm werefiltered with a second-order Butterworth filter at 4 Hz for speed and 3 Hz for acceleration to remove white noise. This data processing step was performed in MATLAB. Following this procedure, the data were imported to R and subsequently screen for errors. See Paper \RNum{2} for a detailed explanation of this screening process. An extensive report of this screening process can be found at the Open Source Framework(OSF) (https://osf.io/egbpr). 

To model the data, our general statistical approach was to leverage multilevel modeling due to the hierarchical data structure of our data. This hierarchy was due to two sources: each skier had three runs in the slalom course on baseline and retention (by design), and the skiers were nested within three different ski academies that conducted the learning experiment together. We employed a Bayesian estimation approach because our goal was to describe the changes and interpret their effects rather than testing any hypothesis \cite{kruschke_bayesian_2018}, where we incorporated this multilevel information in our models. To determine the random effects structure, we used a design-driven approach where our choice of random effects was determined by the design of the experiment \cite{barr_learning_2021,barr_random_2013}. This design-driven model formula failed to converge with the ski academy as a random effect (that is, varying intercept, slope or smooth) due to few varying levels. Therefore, we opted for a simpler model that excluded this multilevel information. To fit the models, we used the brms \cite{burkner_brms_2017} package in R \cite{r_core_team_r_2022}. We used weakly informative priors and performed prior predictive check simulations to inform our decisions. All models (including the priors) are reported in Supplementary Document \textbf{d} in Paper \RNum{2} and the codes are available at OSF  (https://osf.io/egbpr). To extract and visualize the draws from the model, we used the Tidybayes package \cite{kay_tidybayes_nodate}. We chose to report the average mean and contrast for a typical skier (that is, setting the random effects to zero when making posterior predictions).

We used multilevel generalized additive models (GAMs) \cite{pedersen_hierarchical_2019, wood_generalized_2017} for most of our analyses. The reason for our choice is that GAMs allow greater flexibility in modeling nonlinear shapes in data and therefore better allow us to model our kinematic data. In general, a GAM model takes the form of $Y \sim \beta_0 + S(x)$, where $\beta_0$ represents an intercept term, and $S(x)$ is a smooth function of the predictor $x$. The smooth function $S(x)$ in the model is in turn composed of several simple basis functions ($K$), each with an estimated coefficient derived from the data. Researchers can model more complex shapes by adding many basis functions ($K$) to the data. With this approach, risk looms such that the model overfits the sample data and therefore leads to poor out-of-sample generalization. This risk is counteracted in the GAM by penalizing the coefficients of the basis functions such that the model effectively negotiates the tradeoff between the wiggly smoothers and generalizability.


\subsection{Paper 3}
In Paper \RNum{3} (basert på Studie \RNum{2}) ønsket vi å teste om reinforcement learning forbedret sine renntider mer under trening (acquisition) og presterte bedre under retention og transfer enn supervised (free choice) learning, men også å sammenligne opp mot supervised (target skill) learning som var på benchmark gruppe for optimal prestasjon gjennom optimale valg av strategier. To account for these multilevel data structures, we leveraged linear mixed-effects models. To model random effects, we adopted a design-driven approach \cite{barr_random_2013, barr_learning_2021}, where we sought to account for all nonindependence introduced by repeated sampling from the same ski group and skier. We deployed classical frequentist statistics and fitted these models with the lme4 package \cite{bates_fitting_2015} in the R \cite{r_core_team_r_2022} programming language. We used a simple coding scheme for our predictors where the intercepts represent the estimated mean of the cell means and the contrasts represent the estimated difference with respect to the reference level, which we set for reinforcement learning. Two-tailed p values and degrees of freedom for each model were derived using the lmerTest package \cite{kuznetsova_lmertest_2017} via the Satterthwaite approximation method. Alpha was set to 0.05 for all test statistics.




These race times were analyzed using linear mixed-effect regression models. Initially, we planned to normalize the racing times by expressing the racing times as the difference from the straight-gliding time performed at the beginning of every session (like we did in Study \RNum{1}). However, practical considerations led us to deviate from this approach. This change was necessary because we had to flip or shift the course after each day to ensure snow conditions with the least damage. Unfortunately, these adjustments made maintaining a clean, straight-gliding lane difficult since the straight gliding lane crossed many areas with damage to the snow surface (holes) from the previous course set (see Supplementary Methods C for an image of these holes). Collisions with these holes affected the race time, adding noise to the results. Therefore, we used a more conservative approach and analyzed the raw racing times instead of analyzing the normalized racing times.

For the acquisition session, we modeled race time using Session (forced exploration, free choice 1, free choice 2) and Learning group (reinforcement learning, supervised: free choice learning, supervised: target skill learning), and their interactions, as predictors. For retention and transfer, we modeled race times at these sessions, with learning group added as a predictor. In addition, we used the average performance for each skier on the baseline test as a predictor to improve estimate precision and adjust for any group differences at baseline testing. 

To model the effect and development of the strategies we broke the analysis up into different sub-models. One analysis focused on differences in the strategies and groups regarding Forced Exploration, where all participants had completed all strategies. Another analysis examined the transition from Forced Exploration to retention for both supervised (free choice) and reinforcement learning. The final model investigated the development between groups specifically for the "extend with rock skis forward" strategy. Session was coded as a continuous variable in all models. 

I artikkelen har vi også forsøkt å forklare disse tidene, men har valgt å ikke presentere disse analysene i denne thesis og dermed også ikke presentert dem her. 










Due to the hierarchical structure of the data, our general statistical strategy relies on multilevel modeling. At the first level, each skier performed multiple trials during each session. At the second level, each skier was nested within groups of ski teams that performed the experiment together. To account for these multilevel data structures, we leveraged linear mixed-effects models. To model random effects, we adopted a design-driven approach \cite{barr_random_2013, barr_learning_2021}, where we sought to account for all nonindependence introduced by repeated sampling from the same ski group and skier. We deployed classical frequentist statistics and fitted these models with the lme4 package \cite{bates_fitting_2015} in the R \cite{r_core_team_r_2022} programming language. We used a simple coding scheme for our predictors where the intercepts represent the estimated mean of the cell means and the contrasts represent the estimated difference with respect to the reference level, which we set for reinforcement learning. Two-tailed p values and degrees of freedom for each model were derived using the lmerTest package \cite{kuznetsova_lmertest_2017} via the Satterthwaite approximation method. Alpha was set to 0.05 for all test statistics.
