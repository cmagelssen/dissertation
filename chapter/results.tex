I have structured the results as follows: First, I present results that answer "What can skilled skiers do to ski faster on flat sections in slalom?". In this section, I present data from the skiers' race times on the different strategies during Study \RNum{2} and velocity and path length data from the local positioning data from Study \RNum{1}. Then, I present results that answer "How should we train skiers to ski faster on flat sections in slalom?". Here, I first present the results from Study \RNum{1}, which tested whether the contextual interference effect can be leveraged to improve skill learning by creating learning problems for skiers.  . Finally, I present the results from Study \RNum{2}, which tested which teaching signal that is most effective in helping skiers learn the values of strategies to make them pick the best one.  

\section{What can skilled skiers do to ski faster on flat sections in slalom?}


\subsection{Which strategies did the skiers perform best with?}\label{results_strategies}
We begin by assessing which of the four strategies—"stand against", "rock skis forward", "extend", and "extend with rock skis forward—yielded the best average race times for these skilled skiers. To compare these strategies, we collected the race times from the forced exploration session from Study \RNum{2}, where the skiers in all three learning groups tested all strategies. Since we accounted for practice order effects during this testing, by randomly assigning the test order of the strategies to each skier (under the condition that the first and last four trials included all four strategies), we could use these times to compare the effectiveness of the strategies. 

To this end, we employed a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the expected differences between the strategies (Supplementary Table \ref{study3:estimateddifferencebetweenstrategies}). This analysis revealed that skiers on average achieved their best race times using the 'extend with rock skis forward' strategy (16.66 s, 95\% credible interval (CI) = 16.54, 16.77). This strategy was only marginally better than the 'extend' strategy, with a mean difference of just 0.02 s (95\% CI = -0.02, 0.06).  We found a more substantial expected time loss when skiers switched from the 'extend' strategy to the 'rock skis forward' strategy, with an average loss of 0.21 s (95\% CI = 0.16, 0.25). Finally, if the skiers switched from the "rock skis forward" strategy to the "stand against" strategy, the expected time loss was 0.2 s (95\% CI = 0.15, 0.25). Therefore, the strategies skiers used exerted a great impact on the skiers' race times. 

These results show that just making clean, carved turns and resisting the centripetal forces during a turn using the "stand against" strategy is insufficient for achieving fast race times on flat terrain in slalom. Instead, the active movements of the skiers were crucial for achieving fast race times on flats. When the skiers actively "rocked their skis forward", they improved their race time greatly compared to "stand against" only. This finding aligns well with prior findings in slalom skiing that reported a strong correlation between fore and aft movements and energy dissipation, such that more fore movements were associated with greater energy dissipation \cite{reid_turn_2009, reid_kinematic_2010}. Furthermore, studies have shown that faster skiers have a greater range of fore/aft motion and spend a larger portion of the turn skiing with their weight shifted back after gate passage than slower skiers \cite{tjorhom_beskrivelse_2007, reid_kinematic_2010}. Our results extend these findings and provide experimental evidence that "rock skis forward" can be an effective strategy for improving race times on flat terrain in slalom.

However, the 'rock skis forward' strategy resulted in much slower times than did the 'extend' strategy. Predictions from the Lind and Sanders model \cite{lind_physics_2004} indicate that extending the center of mass closer to the axis of rotation during a turn from a laterally inclined position should significantly improve the race time. Without motion capture data, we cannot assess the extent to which skiers extended and the resulting increase in kinetic energy. Nonetheless, the results suggest that skiers' extension movements play a crucial role in slalom performance, contrary to previous beliefs \cite{supej_differential_2008, supej_doba_2001}.

Finally, we found that "extend with rock skis forward" on average was the best strategy. This finding aligns with previous simulations suggesting that this strategy is most effective when skiers pump over rollers \cite{mote_accelerations_1983} and that it can be transferred to skiers executing a turn \cite{reid_kinematic_2010}. However, it is important to emphasize that "extend with rock skis forward" only was marginally better than the "extend" strategy alone. One reason for the limited improvement achieved by adding "rock skis forward" to the "extend" strategy might be that rocking the skis forward during the turn compromised how much the skier could extend toward the turn's axis of rotation. For instance, extensive extension could be challenging if the skier's center of mass was located at the tail of the skis. This issue should be further investigated in future analyses.

One limitation of these timing analyses is that we do not have precise knowledge of how much the skiers moved when executing the strategies or how these strategies affected the mechanical energy during a turn. Therefore, we cannot comment on the skiers' actual execution or the energy mechanics behind each strategy. Future studies should incorporate motion capture to address this gap in understanding.

\end{figure}



\subsection{The kinematic changes following a training intervention on the pumping ("extend") strategy}
From the previous section, we learned that the 'extend' strategy was the second most effective strategy, only marginally surpassed by the 'extend with rock skis forward' strategy. In Study \RNum{1}, we found that skiers significantly improved their race times after a three-day training intervention focused solely on the 'extend' strategy. Our next aim was to examine the kinematic changes that occurred during this intervention to better understand what the skiers learned or did differently. In effect, this knowledge can help us acquire a better understanding of how this strategy exerts an influence on skiing. Since race time in alpine skiing depends on speed and path length, these kinematic changes could manifest as alterations in either speed or path length. We investigated which of these changes were most consistent with the data and whether the kinematic changes aligned with the mechanical theory of pumping. To explore these accounts, we used recording data from a small segment of the slalom course and a subset of skiers (18 out of 66) for whom we had set up a local positioning system in the upper section of the slalom course. This allowed us to quantify both path length and instantaneous speed.

If the pumping mechanism drove the skiers' improvement in race time, we would expect skiers to increase their speed at or immediately after gate passage, at the time when the extension movement occurs. Fig. \ref{fig:lps_speed}a shows the speed profiles for the local positioning system section during baseline and retention. We first describe the average speed trend at baseline and then the contrast between baseline and retention.

In the baseline test, the skiers’ speed decreased for each gate in the local positioning system section compared to their speed during straight gliding, except for a slight speed increase of 0.05 m/s (95\% CI[-0.08, 0.17]) from gate 1 to gate 2. In the other gate sections, the speeds decreased on average by -0.06 m/s (95\% CI[-0.19, 0.07]) from gate 2 to gate 3 and by -0.12 m/s (95\% CI[-0.25, 0]) from gate 3 to gate 4 compared to straight gliding times. We report only the comparisons at the gates because the gates mark a fixed reference point. After the training intervention, the skiers increased their entry speed into the local positioning section (gate 1) by an average of 0.24 m/s (95\% CI [0.19, 0.29]) compared to the baseline speed. From this gate, the skiers tended to increase their speed throughout the section. Specifically, the skiers increased their speed on average by 0.07 m/s (95\%CI [0.01, 0.12]) from gate 1 to gate 2, followed by a slight decrease of -0.02 m/s (95\%CI [-0.05, 0.02]) from gate 2 to gate 3. Subsequently, the speed of the skiers increased again by 0.1 m/s (95\% CI[0.06, 0.14]) from gate 3 to gate 4. Therefore, the speed of the skiers increased almost incrementally from gate to gate. In addition, the speed profiles appeared wavier, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:lps_speed}b. In general, the pattern of these waveforms was that skiers increased their speed after gate passage and continued to rise until the skiers were approximately midway between two gates. After that, the speed decreased to the gate before it rose again. As such, the speed profile changed massively from baseline to retention.

    \label{fig:lps_speed}
\end{figure}


Next, we analyzed the path length, for which we did not expect would undergo big changes based on the recording system we used. At the baseline test, we found that the total path length from gate 1 to gate 2 was 10.00 m (95\% CI[9.97, 10.10]), 10.7 m (95\% CI[10.70, 10.80]) from gate 2 to gate 3, and 10.10 m (95\% CI[10.10, 10.10]) from gate 3 to gate 4, while it was 8.19 m (95\% CI[8.15, 8.23]) from gate 4 to the end of the section. Notably, the reason for the lower estimate from gate 4 to the end is that this section was shorter than the other gate sections because the section ended before gate 5. Fig. \ref{fig:lps_path}a shows the total path length during each gate in the local positioning system section. Overall, we found no clear systematic differences in path length from baseline to retention across the gates. Surprisingly, the expected mean difference was 0.17 m (95\% CI[0.06, 0.28]) longer from gate 1 to gate 2 in retention. This expected mean difference did not overlap with the baseline estimate. Conversely, the expected mean difference overlapped considerably between baseline and retention for gate 2 to gate 3 (-0.02 m, 95\% CI[-0.14, 0.10]) and for gate 3 to gate 4 (0.02 m, 95\% CI[-0.02, 0.06]). In contrast, we observed an increased path length in retention from gate 4 to the end of the section (0.08 m, 95\%CI[0.04, 0.13]). In summary, we found changes in path length for some gate sections, while others showed minor differences. The general trend was that the skiers skied a longer path length during retention than at baseline. Fig. \ref{fig:lps_path}b shows the expected mean difference in total path length for each gate in the local positioning section. 

Our data indicate that the intervention increased the speed and path length in certain gate sections. How does this align with previous alpine research and mechanical theories on pumping? First, these and previous results suggest that the pumping ("extend") strategy might exert a real impact on skiers' speed and performance in flat sections, contrary to previous beliefs \cite{supej_differential_2008, supej_doba_2001}. The increased speed from turn to turn and the distinct change in the speed profile align well with expectations from a pumping mechanism to increase the speed from turn to turn. It therefore appears that skiers can pump themselves to higher speeds and that this is an important mechanism to leverage in align with Lind and Sander's model \cite{lind_physics_2004}. We also observed a trend where the path length increased slightly from gate to gate, although this varied significantly from turn to turn. Several factors could explain this increased path length, which we cannot quantify or separate using the local positioning system. One possibility is that pumping increases the path length because the extension movement exerts more force on the skis, causing them to bend and turn more. However, this could also result from measurement errors from the local positioning systems or differences in the course setting.

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/figure_path5_2.pdf}

    \label{fig:lps_path}
\end{figure}




To conclude, we found that the skiers' speed profiles underwent significant changes, consistent with the changes we would expect from pumping. We also found that the skiers tended to ski a longer path at the retention session, yet accomplished better descent times. However, it is important to consider the limitations of this study, which we discuss further in the methodological section. 

\section{How should we train skiers to ski faster on flat sections in slalom?}


\subsection{Using contextual interference to create challenging problems for skiers did not improve perfor}
Our next question was whether coaches can leverage contextual interference to create learning problems to improve learning. In Study \RNum{1}, the skiers trained to pump on flat sections in slalom either in one course per day (blocked practice) or in different courses randomly assigned each day (interleaved practice). Based on the typical results (at least laboratory-based studies) of the contextual interference effect \cite{simon_metacognition_2001, shea_context_1983, hall_contextual_1994, shea_contextual_1979, tsutsui_contextual_1998, thomas_using_2021}, we hypothesized that the blocked learning group would perform better during the training sessions (acquisition) than the interleaved learning group because they repeatedly skied on the same course and therefore could perfect their performance on this course before switching to the next (thus experiencing less interference). During the first four trials (trial block 1), we found no statistically significant differences between the interleaved and blocked practice groups on course A ($\beta$ = 0.17, 95\% CI[-0.19, 0.53], $t$(91.971) = 0.95, $p$ =  0.344), course B ($\beta$ = -0.03 , 95\% CI[-0.38, 0.33], $t$( 91.241 ) = -0.14, $p$ = 0.886) or course C ($\beta$ = 0.14 , 95\% CI[-0.21, 0.5], $t$(92.069) = 0.81, $p$ = 0.421). Both learning groups improved their race times over the subsequent trial blocks (blocks 2 and 3)(Supplementary Table \ref{paper1: racetimechangepercourse}). However, we found no statistically significant greater improvement in the blocked practice group for any course (Supplementary Table \ref{paper1: racetimeinteraction}). The differences between the learning groups in trial block 2 or trial block 3 were also not statistically significant (Supplementary Table \ref{paper1: racetimedifferencebetweentreatments}). Fig \ref{fig:enter-label})a shows the mean race time estimates for the three trial blocks during acquisition for the three courses. Based on these findings, we did not find evidence that the blocked learning group improved more during the training sessions than the interleaved learning group. 

Our second hypothesis was that the interleaved learning group would outperform the blocked learning group on the retention test conducted after a three-day retention interval. However, we found no evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference between learning groups for course A ($\beta$ = 0.09, 95\% CI[-0.12, 0.3],$t$(45.131) = 0.89 , $p$ = 0.379), B ($\beta$ = 0.13, 95\% CI [-0.18, 0.44], $t$(45.566) = 0.85, $p$ = 0.397), or C ($\beta$ = 0.05, 95\% CI [-0.29, 0.39], $t$(44.813) = 0.29, $p$ = 0.772). To follow up these "null effects", I have fitted the same models as Bayesian models and run a Bayes Factor (BF) analysis to quantify the relative evidence for the two hypotheses to provide additional support for our conclusions. For these analyses, I set the prior for the distribution of differences between the learning groups to 0.05 seconds because values below 0.10 seconds are too small to be considered meaningful. From these models, we found considerable evidence in favor of an absence of an effect of learning group for course A  (BF = 0.972), course B (BF = 0.957), and course C (BF = 0.988). Fig. \ref{fig:ci_bf} shows the prior and posterior distributions for the three slalom courses. Since Bayes Factors are sensitive to model specifications and priors, I performed a sensitivity analysis for different prior distributions but came to the same conclusion. Therefore, we found no convincing evidence that the interleaved learning group improved retention.

    \label{fig:ci_bf}
\end{figure}

To begin, our study aligns with previous research that has not found a contextual interference effect in real-world tasks or more complex activities \cite{brady_theoretical_1998, barreiros_contextual_2007, wulf_principles_2002}. One reason for this is that the skiers were skilled, and the sport is complex. A comparable study revealed no significant effect of frequent task switching (alternating between two types of serves in the interleaved learning group) on learning tennis serves among younger players\cite{buszard_quantifying_2017}. However, the tennis players in this interleaved learning group improved their serves in competition (transfer) compared to those in the blocked learning group. In contrast, \cite{hall_contextual_1994} found that baseball players batted better after training with interleaved learning over several weeks than after training with blocked learning. The key difference between these two studies is that the former manipulated contextual interference between two different skill types, while the latter manipulated variations of the same skill. Therefore, the way the manipulation was performed (between skills versus between variations of one skill) might be a contributing factor. However, our study is most consistent with the manipulation type in \cite{hall_contextual_1994} study and should have corroborated the findings from that study. Therefore, it appears that this is not the best explanation for our data.

Another reason for the difference in results between our study and previous studies on contextual interference is that skiing is a continuous skill, while most of the literature focuses on learning discrete skills\cite{lee_distribution_1988, lee_distribution_1989}. Although contextual interference has been found for continuous tasks\cite{pauwels_contextual_2014, tsutsui_contextual_1998}, these findings come from beginners and relatively simple tasks. According to the 3R framework of motor learning \cite{tsay_strategy_2023}, skilled performers are adept at recognizing changes in the learning environment and quickly adapt their control policy to improve performance if a better alternative exists. Therefore, the skiers in the interleaved learning group may not have experienced significant interference because they quickly identified the new task and quickly switched to a more effective control policy. Since ski runs endure over a long time, skiers could adjust their control policy within the first few gates without significantly compromising their performance.

A third potential counteracting factor of the contextual interference effect in our study was the long rotation time between each run, which may have contributed to forgetting. Skiers took approximately 8 minutes between trials to ride the lift to the top and prepare for a new run. This intertrial interval is significantly longer than those used in laboratory tasks with discrete tasks \cite{barreiros_contextual_2007}. The extended time between trials might have caused skiers to forget and lose connections between trials, which is a mechanism suggested to underlie the contextual interference effect \cite{lee_locus_1983, lee_can_1985}. This perspective also aligns with the new theory of disuse \cite{bjork_new_1992}, which posits that lengthening the spacing between trials can increase forgetting yet enhance learning by reducing memory retrieval strength before each trial. Thus, both the interleaved and blocked groups might have experienced favorable learning conditions for skill learning due to the long intertrial.

Although we did not find significant differences between the learning groups, this does not imply that we do not recommend coaches frequently switch courses to create learning problems for skiers. Our findings only suggest that within the short duration of our training study (equivalent to a typical ski camp), we found no convincing benefits of interleaved learning. However, an important general training principle is the specificity principle \cite{lee_chapter_1988}, which states that training should meet the demands of the sport. In alpine skiing, skiers constantly encounter new competition courses, making it crucial for training to cover this range of variation. Frequently changing courses could help avoid the formation of undesirable habits \cite{du_relationship_2022}, such as skiers learning a solution to a situation only by perfecting it on a single course. While our study did not provide data to support this, it is a potential area for future research.

One limitation of this study is that the interleaved and blocked learning groups trained together, which could have created some treatment diffusion when the skiers observed each other from the lift or the top of the course. Unfortunately, we were unable to control for this potential limitation in this study due to space and time constraints in the ski hall. Another limitation is the absence of a transfer test, which could have provided important insights into the learning groups’ adaptation to a new slalom course.

To conclude, we did not find convincing evidence that coaches could leverage contextual interference to design challenging learning problems to improve learning.

\subsection{Using reinforcement-guided teaching signals improved training and performance compared to supervised-guided teaching signal}
The final question this doctoral study addressed was which teaching signal is most effective for teaching skiers to make optimal strategy choices, thereby impacting their performance and learning. In Study \RNum{2}, skiers learned the value of different strategies through two opposing teaching signals: supervised learning and reinforcement learning. In the supervised (free choice) learning group, coaches instructed skiers on which strategy to use, either one they believed to be the best or most appropriate for the skier. This method represents the conventional teaching strategy in alpine skiing. To complement this learning group, we included a supervised (target skill) learning group, which served as a benchmark for the upper limit of performance achievable through optimal strategy choices. In this learning group, coaches instructed skiers to select the strategy we defined as theoretically best based on mechanics and field observations of elite skiers. We compared these two supervised learning groups to a reinforcement learning group, where skiers learned the values of the strategies by trying them and learning from evaluations (that is, race times) instead of from a coach.

    \label{fig:rlstudy_racetime}
\end{figure}

Tp begin, we expected the reinforcement learning group to improve their race time more during the three acquisition sessions than did the supervised (free choice) learning group. We hypothesized that this improvement would come about from improved learning to select effective strategies. Importantly, we did not expect the reinforcement learning group to select better strategies than the supervised (target skill) learning group because this group was instructed to select the theoretical best strategy. First, we analyzed the differences between the learning groups during the forced exploration acquisition session, where all groups were required to try all strategies. Therefore, we did not expect to find differences between the groups at this session. The results confirmed our expectations; we found no statistically significant differences between the reinforcement learning group and the supervised (free choice) learning group ($\beta$ = 0.06, 95\% CI [-0.2, 0.32], $t$(92.727) = 0.48, $p$ = 0.631) or between the supervised (target skill) learning group  ($\beta$ = 0.18, 95\% CI[-0.08, 0.44], $t$(92.663) = 1.37, $p$ = 0.174).  

When we allowed the learning groups to choose their own strategies—skiers in the reinforcement learning group and coaches in the two supervised learning groups—during the next two sessions in acquisition (free choice sessions 1 and 2), we expected them to show the development patterns described above. First, we observed that all learning groups significantly improved their race times over the course of the free -choice sessions during acquisition (Supplementary Table \ref{table_racetime_acquisition_change}). The improvements across these sessions indicate that the choice of strategies exerted a great influence on race time in all the learning groups. Consistent with our expectations, the three learning groups also developed differently. The supervised (target skill) learning group, where skiers were coached to select the theoretically best strategy, showed a significantly greater improvement than the reinforcement learning group from forced exploration to free choice 1 ($\beta$ = -0.12, 95\% CI[-0.22, -0.03], $t$(91.777) = -2.58, $p$ = 0.012). Conversely, the supervised (free choice) learning group demonstrated a descriptively poorer progression than the reinforcement learning group, although this difference was not statistically significant ($\beta$ = 0.08, 95\% CI[-0.02, 0.17], $t$(92.5) = 1.61, $p$ = 0.110). Continuing this trend, comparing initial performance during forced exploration to performance in the final acquisition session (free choice 2), the reinforcement learning group improved significantly more than did the supervised (free choice) learning group ($\beta$ = 0.14, 95\% CI[0.02, 0.26], $t$(95.743) = 2.26, $p$ = 0.026). For the same comparison, the supervised (target skill) learning group no longer showed significantly greater improvement than the reinforcement learning group  ($\beta$ = 0.02, 95\% CI[-0.11, 0.14], $t$(95.651) = 0.26, $p$ = 0.798). This is due in part to the continued improvement of the reinforcement learning group but also to a descriptive decline from free choice 1 to free choice 2 in the supervised (target skill) learning group, attenuating their initially greater improvement rate. However, we did not find statistical evidence that the reinforcement learning group performed better than the supervised (free choice) or supervised (target skill) learning groups at free choice 1 or free choice 2 (Supplementary Table \ref{table_racetime_acquisition_groupdifference}). Fig. \ref{fig: racetime}a presents the mean race time estimates during the three acquisition sessions. 

In the retention session, the skiers independently chose their strategies, irrespective of their assigned groups. We reasoned that at this point, the reinforcement learning group had learned to understand which strategies were most effective and chose them. Therefore, our hypothesis was that the reinforcement learning group would outperform the supervised (free choice) learning group in retention due to better strategy selection learned from observing the race times to evaluate the strategies. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the reinforcement learning group performed significantly better than the supervised (free choice) learning group did ($\beta$ = 0.12, 95\% CI[0.01, 0.24], $t$(101.422) = 2.12, $p$ = 0.037). The difference between the reinforcement learning and supervised (target skill) learning groups also favored reinforcement learning but was smaller and not statistically significant  ($\beta$ = 0.07, 95\% CI[ -0.04, 0.19], $t$(101.63) = 1.27, $p$ = 0.206). We therefore provide evidence that the reinforcement learning group performed better at retention than did the supervised (free choice) learning group. Descriptively, the reinforcement learning group performed better, even than the supervised (target skill) learning group, which served as an upper bound reference. Fig. \ref{fig: racetime}b presents the mean race time estimates during retention. 

We also hypothesized that reinforcement learning would transfer their skill learning to a new slalom course compared to the supervised (free choice) learning group. Similar to retention, the reinforcement learning group performed better than the supervised (free choice) group but the difference was smaller and not statistically significant ($\beta$ = 0.1, 95\% CI[-0.02, 0.21], $t$( 99.979) = 1.7, $p$  = 0.091). The race times for the reinforcement learning and supervised (target skill) learning groups were on average identical ($\beta$ = 0, 95\% CI[-0.12, 0.11], $t$(100.033) = -0.04, $p$ = 0.967). Therefore, we did not find convincing evidence that reinforcement learning improved transfer. Fig. \ref{fig: racetime}c presents the mean race time estimates during the transfer session. 

We proposed that the enhanced performance of the reinforcement learning group, compared to the supervised (free choice) group, came about from better strategy selection because they learned the strategies' values directly from observing their race times. We tested this prediction by examining whether the reinforcement learning group developed a greater probability of choosing the theoretically best strategy ("extend with rock skis forward") or each skier's estimated best strategy over the free choice sessions in the acquisition and retention and transfer sessions. However, no convincing evidence was found for this hypothesis with any of these tests. Instead we found support for two other explanations. First, we found that the skiers in the reinforcement learning group who made 'suboptimal' choices during the retention session had a lower 'cost'—the expected difference between a suboptimally chosen strategy and the skier's estimated best strategy—than the skiers in the supervised (free choice) learning group. The reinforcement learning group, therefore, appears to have learned to select strategies that offered comparable outcomes and to avoid those that carried the risk of substantially worse performance. Second, we found that the reinforcement learning group improved more on the 'extend' strategy over the course of the sessions than did the supervised (free choice) learning group. One possibility is that the reinforcement learning group discovered that the "extend" strategy alone provided almost the full benefits on its own and chose this strategy because it was simpler than "extend with rock skis forward", subsequently refining this strategy. I have chosen not to include figures or results in this thesis due to space constraints. For complete results and discussion, see paper \RNum{3}.

Our results suggest that reinforcement learning can prove to be a useful teaching strategy for improving training and performance among elite athletes. The estimated group difference was substantial and may have exerted a real impact on skiers' skill development. Assuming that a full slalom course of approximately 45 seconds includes a flat section lasting approximately 15 seconds (quite typical), and considering that a slalom race consists of two runs, the 0.12-second difference can translate into an improved Fédération Internationale de Ski (FIS) world ranking of 27 positions for females and 65 positions for males, based on a median ranking of 600 in our sample (see Supplement Discussion \textbackslash{}ref\{supdiscussion\}). However, it is important to note that the estimated effect is still smaller than our smallest effect size of interest, a benchmark set for other conditions that we were unable to fulfill due to time and space limitations in the ski hall. 

One limitation of the study is that we did not use motion capture to analyze the skiers' execution of the strategies. Consequently, we cannot describe the actual execution of the strategies beyond noting that they were able to perform them during the familiarization test. Based on our results, it is likely that the reinforcement learning group learned not only at the strategy level but also at an execution level, which we were unable to quantify in this study.
